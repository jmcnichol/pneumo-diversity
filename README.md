# pneumo-diversity
This is a project for STAT840 (Statistical genetics) at SFU. A comparison of diversity measures for the pneumocaccus [data from Croucher et al. (2013)]. The aim of this project is to explore the apparent widespread NFDS exhibited in the pneumococcal accessory genome.

The bulk of the calculations and tests are preformed in ``mass-cog-diveristy.R``, with the calculation of phylogenetic diveristy and some general exploration of the trees in ``tree-diversity.R``. I looked a functional groups of COGs in `functional-groups.R`.
